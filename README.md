# Time Series Modeling Dashboard

This project was forked from the project that arose from [DataKind's](http://datakind.org/) collaboration with [eGovernments foundation](http://egovernments.org/) ([Original Repo](https://github.com/egovernments/analytics)).

This project was built by the team to quickly try out different models, for multiple datasets. At some point, we figured out that this could be a useful standalone tool, so we forked it into a separate project.

It aims to provide a easy way to build simple forecasting models, by allowing quick exploration of the data and different models.


It's still a WIP, for now containing only simple models like Arima and ETS. We plan to continue to add other models, including state of the art models. We also hope to expand this to other applications in TSM like Change Detection, Breakout detection, etc.
